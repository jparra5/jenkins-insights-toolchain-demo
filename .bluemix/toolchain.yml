name: "Simple Cloud Foundry toolchain with Jenkins"
description: "With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application by using a Jenkins server. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, or you can link to your own GitHub repository. This toolchain is preconfigured for Jenkins continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, online editing, and alert notification.\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
